# corex-project-6
This project is doing Component tests, mocking dependencies such as Database and HTTP server. The idea is also to fake integration tests, because they are the same idea, but with real dependencies.

- Tests are in Product/Product.IntegrationTests/ProductScenarios.cs
- Controller is in /Product/Product.API/Controllers/ProductsController.cs
